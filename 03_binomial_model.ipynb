    "## Binomial One Step Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a very simple model to describe stock price movements. It will be\n",
    "enough to go through the mains notions of derivatives pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model description\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time\n",
    "\n",
    "By \"One Step\", we suppose that only one unit of time occurs. We start at time\n",
    "$0$ to go at time $1$. This unit of time can represent any period (6 months, 1\n",
    "year, ...) and should always be explicited in the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non Risky Asset (Cash)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $B_t$ denote a non risky asset price (let's say, a governmental note), and\n",
    "$S_t$ a stock price. $B_t$ is deterministic:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "  B_0 &=& 1, \\\\\n",
    "  B_1 &=& 1+R.\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stock\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $d < u$ and $p_u+p_d=1$, the stock price is a random variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "  S_0 &=& S \\\\\n",
    "  S_1 &=&s \\cdot Z =\n",
    "  \\left\\{\n",
    "  \\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "  S \\cdot u,&\\mbox{ with proba }p_u\\\\\n",
    "  S \\cdot d,&\\mbox{ with proba }p_d,\\\\\n",
    "  \\end{array}\n",
    "  \\right.\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $u$ stands for \"up\" scenario, $d$ for \"down\" scenario\n",

    "### Portfolio and arbitrage\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector $h=(x,y)$ defines a portfolio on market $(B,S)$ at time $0$. $x$ is the\n",
    "quantity of cash, and $y$ the number of stocks in this portfolio. Quantities can\n",
    "be positive of negative (negative $x$ means that cash is borrowed, negative $y$\n",
    "that the porfolio holds a short position on the stock).\n",
    "\n",
    "We formulate the following hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fractionnal, long and short position are allowed\n",
    "2. No bid/ask spread\n",
    "3. No transaction costs\n",
    "4. Liquid market: we can buy and sell any quantity at market price\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Portfolio Value\n",
    "\n",
    "<result>The value of the portfolio $h$ is the stochastic process\n",
    "$V_t^h = x B_t+ yS_t$,  $t \\in \\{0,1\\}$</result>\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "  V_0^h &=& x + yS \\\\\n",
    "  V_1^h &=& x(1+R) + ySZ \n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arbitrage Portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, we have the tools to formally define an arbitrage. **An\n",
    "arbitrage portfolio** is a portfolio such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "  V_0^h &=& 0 \\\\\n",
    "  \\mathbb{P}(V_1^h > 0) &>& 0 \\\\\n",
    "  \\mathbb{P}(V_1^h \\leq 0) &=& 0\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The existence of such a portfolio is a market anomaly. A market is said without\n",
    "arbitrage opportunity if there is no arbitrage portfolio (noted: **AoA**).\n",
    "\n",
    "### AoA\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Condition for AoA\n",
    "\n",
    "<result>the 1-step binomial model is *AOA* if and only if \n",
    "$d \\leq (1+R) \\leq u$.</result>\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove it, construct arbitrage portfolio (by buying or selling stock).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Risk Neutral Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "<result>This market is AoA if and only if there exist a probability $\\mathbb{Q}$\n",
    "such that: $S_0 = \\frac{1}{1+R}\\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}[S_1]$</result>\n",
    "\n",
    "This probability is called the *martingale*, or *risk-neutral* probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derivative product\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition (derivative)**: a derivative (contingent claim) is a random \n",
    "variable $X$ written as a function $X=\\Phi(S)$ of the stock price. This is \n",
    "a contract that allow to its possessor to be paid $X$. $\\Phi$ is the payoff \n",
    "function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical example is an european call option, with exercise price $K > sd$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X=\\left\\{\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "su-K,&  if \\quad Z=u\\\\\n",
    "0,& if \\quad Z=d\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "\\right.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we determine the price of such a contract? We note $\\Pi(t,X)$ it's \n",
    "price. We have obviously $\\Pi(1,X)=X$. The question is what is $\\Pi(0,X)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition (replicable)**: A derivative is said to be replicable if there \n",
    "exists a portfolio $h$ such that $$\\mathbb{P}(V_1^h = X) = 1$$.\n",
    "This porfolio is called the hedge portfolio. \n",
    "\n",
    "If every derivative is replicable the market is said to be **complete**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pricing by replication\n",
    "\n",
    "By AoA arguments, if a derivative is replicable its price can't be different \n",
    "than the value at $0$ of it's replication porfolio ($V_0^h$)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    " \\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "   x &=& \\frac{1}{1+R}\\frac{u\\Phi(Sd)-d\\Phi(Su)}{u-d} \\\\\n",
    "   y &=& \\frac{\\Phi(Su)-\\Phi(Sd)}{Su-Sd}.\n",
    " \\end{eqnarray}\n",
    " $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**exercise**: prove that if 2 replication porfolios exist, their prices at 0 \n",
    "should be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk neutral pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "First, have a look of a pricing of a Call of strike $K = 100$, with $S = 100$, $Su = 120$ ans $Sd = 90$ with probabilities 50%. If we replace historical probabilities with $q_u=1/3$ and $q_d = 2/3$ we find that $\\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}[Call(S_1)]$ equals the replication portfolio value at $t_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the point! We can reformulate previous replication porfolio value at $t_0$ to make $q_u$ and $q_d$ appear. Let's do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    " \\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "   \\Pi(0;X) &=& V_0^h=x+sy \\\\\n",
    "   ~~ &=& \\frac{1}{1+R}\\left\\{ \\Phi(Su)  \\frac{(1+R)-d}{u-d} + \\Phi(Sd)\\frac{u-(1+R)}{u-d}\\right\\} \\\\\n",
    "   ~~ &=& \\frac{1}{1+R}\\left\\{\\Phi(Su)\\cdot q_u + \\Phi(Sd) \\cdot q_d \\right \\} \\\\\n",
    "   \\Pi(0;X) &=& \\frac{1}{1+R}\\mathbb{E}^Q[X]\n",
    " \\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Subjectives proba $q_u$ and $q_d$ have no link with historical probabilities\n",
    "2. To compute derivatives prices, we have to use *risk neutral* computations\n",
    "3. Pricing is then independent from investors preferences\n",
    "4. This is the core message of Black-and-Scholes: pricing not an insurance\n",
    "   business. It's not about pooling premium to give payoff back, it's about\n",
    "   replication!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi steps model\n",
    "\n",
    "$t = 0, ... , T$\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi steps model is very similar to the one step model. Some adaptations \n",
    "have to be made to define the notion of *self-financed portfolio* and \n",
    "arbitrage, but the overall theory holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Self-financed portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "A **portfolio strategy** is a stochastic process \n",
    "${h_t = (x_t, y_t); \\ t = 1, ..., T}$ such that $h_t$ is a funcion of \n",
    "$S_0, ... , S_{t-1}$. The associated portfolio value is defined by:\n",
    "$$V_t^h = x_t(1+R)+y_t S_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy is dependent from all information available until time $t_{t-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A portfolio strategy is said to be **self-financed** if for all $t = 1, ...,T-1$, \n",
    "the following equality holds: $$x_t(1+R)+y_tS_t = x_{t+1}+y_{t+1}S_t$$ It\n",
    "means that this strategy does not require to put extra cash (nor generates extra\n",
    "cash) when its position in Bond and risky asset are updated at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### AoA\n",
    "\n",
    "An arbitrage opportunity is a self-financed portfolio $V_t^h$ such that:\n",
    "$$\n",
    " \\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "   V_0^h &=& 0 \\\\\n",
    "   \\mathbb{P}(V_T^h \\geq 0) &=& 1 \\\\\n",
    "   \\mathbb{P}(V_T^h > 0) &>& 0\n",
    " \\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Same **property** holds for AoA. The multi step mode is AoA if and only if, \n",
    "$d \\leq 1 + R \\leq u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Martingale probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Martingale probabilities $q_u$ and $q_d$ are defined such that:\n",
    "$$S = \\frac{1}{1+R}\\mathbb{E}^{\\mathbb{Q}}[S_{t+1}|S_t]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this multi step model, things are written in terms of conditionnal\n",
    "expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pricing by replication\n",
    "\n",
    "A derivative $X$ is replicable if there exist a self-financed portfolio such\n",
    "that $V_T^h = X_T$. If every derivative is replicable we say that the market\n",
    "is **complete**.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as expected, if $X$ is replicable by $V_t^h$, its price process is:\n",
    "$$\\Pi(t,X)=V_t^h; \\ t=0,...,T$$."
